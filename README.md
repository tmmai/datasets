Thank you for reading! Please feel free to let me know if there's any resources like must-read research articles/books and critical concepts related to ML/NLP/DL that can aid in my learning process! 

Currently reading: 
- Designing Machine Learning Systems: An Iterative Process for Production-Ready Applications, Chip Huyen
- Stanford CS 229 Lecture Notes, Andrew Ng (to refresh on fundamental concepts)
